	<!--MANICURE-->
	<h2>Aurora Spa Manicure<br>Natural Nail Treatments</h2>
	<p>When time is of the essence the Aurora Spa Manicure will leave your hands looking and feeling well groomed. Your nails are filed and cuticles are pushed back before a luxurious hand and arm exfoliation. A relaxing hand and arm massage follows, concluding with the application of the polish of your choice.</p>
	<p>For the ultimate in hand and nail care why not go for the deluxe version. Your nails are filed then an invigorating lower arm and hand exfoliation is followed by an application of cuticle cream and a nourishing mask. Your hands are then placed into heated mittens for 5 - 10 minutes to aid the absorption of the deeply nourishing ingredients before your cuticles are pushed back. You will then enjoy a luxurious hand and arm massage before the application of the polish of your choice.</p>
	<p>Price - £35</p>
